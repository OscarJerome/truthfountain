                  <h4 class="title">Lango Evangelization agenda</h4>
                  <p class="description">Lango Evangelization Agenda 
                    In the year 2019 the lord sent us to preach in population centers in Lango region in Northern Uganda and today we have held over 40 forty crusades in the villages, 100 crusade in a secular radio stations, outreaches in schools, hospitals, etc. More than 30,000 souls won to Christ, sick healed, demon posssed delivered and many others.
                    <span class="collapse" id="langoAgendaCollapse">
                      Less than a week to the first outreach on this agenda, I had a dream in which I was reprimanding three boys who were very busy harvesting some treasure (honey) from an anthill (mound) in a nearby bush.
                      When they wouldn't take heed to my caution of impending danger, I left, but was very concerned that I had failed in my mission as an adult to help them.
                      This dream came true the first day of the crusade when we were told that some three boys in the community, where we were preaching the good news, struggled over honey they were harvesting from a nearby ant-hill, ending up in one of them being burnt to death when his two fellows felt overpowered in the contest, one retaliating by torching the bush they were in. The
                      fires surrounded and killed their other friend who was now left alone to enjoy the well-earned honey! His inferno tattered body was not yet laid to rest by the first day of the crusade!
                      First, I was very disturbed by that unfortunate happening, but second, the Lord reminded me he had shown me a sign that we were meant to embark on this journey of the one tribe evangelization, and that it was critical we warned the people of the impending inferno of hell, whereas everyone seems to be going about their daily routines and normal life haggles. The gospel is not condemnation but justification through Jesus Christ.
                      It was the fifth of January 2019 when the Lord emphatically ministered to, me, Pastor James to preach in all population centers within the Lango region. I heard him say; "I brought you to planet earth through this tribe and have made you a blessing to Nations and so you have an obligation to reach your own people with the gospel".
                      There were other explanations accompanying including the definition of what a true pastor is, not just enjoying the recognitions of your community, church or denomination, in public and other social places, but to be sold out and fully bent to the task of our Biblical calling. This happened after preaching the gospel in other countries in 2018 with last being held at the 90th North America Christian Convention in Indiana, Indianapolis and Bremerton, Washington, USA .
                      From that vision, I developed a theme "Lango Evangelization Agenda". The Lango evangelization agenda will not only go to villages but to schools, colleges, institutions, prisons, hospitals, etc.weather. mostations, local newspapisions, hospitals, ehe unreached. The mobilization is to reach the tribal group, not for the benefit of our church, but to fulfil the God-given vision. We will work with any believing church be it Anglican, Charismatics, Baptist, Pentecostal, etc.
                      
                      The main goal of Lango Evangelization agenda is not to open a new church or promote any church agenda but to preach salvation, healing and deliverance through Jesus Christ, besides challenging the Church of Christ to wake up and take the great commission seriously. Just like we have seen God save, heal and deliver in other countries, we want to see the same here at motherland. Our people should get delivered from poverty, drunkenness, immorality, witchcraft, occultism, etc.
                      For our tribe mates living outside the districts of Lango and in the diasporas, they should really take great interest in this evangelization agenda because we're going to preach to their brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, uncles and unties; of which if we don't preach to them they will be the very people corrupting the money sent, getting various illnesses because of intoxication from Alcohol, other drugs, poor hygiene, and other predicaments. This same burden applies to all God's people around the world.
                      Even other international bodies and charities who send funding to Lango sub-region should take more interest in funding this work because some of the work they are doing, if not sheltered by the preaching of the gospel, which alone is the bedrock for true stewardship, faithfulness, and productivity, can't rest assured of the much needed results and transformation they envision to achieve! Some of the projects they are doing are not yielding results because the very people who these programs are to benefit are corrupting the money and so it's only through preaching of the gospel that their lives can change.

                  <p class="description">The youth department is one of the key departments in the ministry that is mentoring many young people both at the church and in the community. We have a holistic approach of mentorship where we are building the youth spiritually, mentally, academically and professionally.
                    Through our school outreaches, in 2024, we were able to reach out to 40 schools where we guided, counselled and preached to over 25,000 students in high schools and institutions. 2,446 of these students gave their lives to Christ.
                    We also do community outreaches where we preach in hospitals, prisons, streets and villages. All these outreaches are led by the young people.
                    As the word of God defines true religion as helping the poor and the needy, we have a charity wing of the youth department. We always distribute clothes, shoes and other personal effects to the vulnerable people in the community. All this is through the support from the youth and donations from the well wishers.
                    Between 2025 and 2026, we have a vision of reaching out to over 100,000 young people with a vision of seeing 12,000 people giving their lives to Christ. We also have a vision of expanding our charity work into other vulnerable communities.
